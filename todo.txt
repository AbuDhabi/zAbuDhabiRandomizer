--- what's the pattern, kenneth?????
--- if barrelable = good to go
--- if not barrelable, but can be made without surface conditions = good to go
--- if not barrelable, can't be made without surface conditions, then don't use it? but think about where it even can be used
--- nauvis -> inner planets is fine
--- inner planets -> aquilo is fine, if possible
--- RULE: If it (is barrelable) or (producible with (only items) or (barrelable fluids) w/o (surface conditions))
