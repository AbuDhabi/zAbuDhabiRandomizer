--- what's the pattern, kenneth?????
--- if barrelable = good to go
--- if not barrelable, but can be made without surface conditions = good to go
--- if not barrelable, can't be made without surface conditions, then don't use it? but think about where it even can be used
--- nauvis -> inner planets is fine
--- inner planets -> aquilo is fine, if possible
--- RULE: If it (is barrelable) or (producible with (only items) or (barrelable fluids) w/o (surface conditions))


Raw resource identification:
 - subgroup = "raw-resource" identifies some basic resources from Nauvis, solid ones
 - subgroup = "{planet}-processes" includes the rest of the solids, but also non-raw materials
    - if it's here, maybe just check if there is a recipe, and if so, get rid of it

There's data.raw.planet with a list of planets, maybe can infer ores from them?
Patches and objects:
    planet.{nauvis|fulgora|gleba|vulcanus|aquilo}.map_gen_settings.autoplace_settings.entity
        entity is probably the top level in data.raw
    planet.{nauvis|fulgora|gleba|vulcanus|aquilo}.map_gen_settings.autoplace_settings.tile.settings

data.raw.autoplace-control has a list of raw resources, kind of
    doesn't really define what items and fluids come from them

data.raw.resource has another list, including other planetary solids
    resource.calcite.minable.result is the raw solid resource (string)
    resource.lithium-brine.minable.results.name is the fluid resource (string)

data.raw.tile contains a list of tiles
    data.raw.tile.water.fluid is probably a key in the data.raw.fluid list
    yeah, changing this works!
